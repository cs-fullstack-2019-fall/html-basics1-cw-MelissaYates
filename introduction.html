        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Raised in the Waltham Road of Mandeville, Manchester, about two hours away Kingston, I had my first exposure to musical artists from my
            Seventh-Day Adventist mother who played music a lot in our home on Sundays. The musicians on rotation represented a diasporic melangeâ€”American R&B and soul singers such as Patti La Belle and
            Etta James, as well as classic reggae artists including the Jamaican greats Beres Hammond, Dennis Brown, and, of course, Bob Marley.</p>
